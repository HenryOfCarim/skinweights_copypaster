# Skin Weights CopyPaster

I didn't find a way to copy-paste skin weights data from one vertex to selection for free. So I wrote this somehow. Crude and ugly and tested only on Blender 3.1 - 4.3 but it seems to work

## How it looks

## Usage

## Installation
1. Press green `Code` button>download Zip
2. Launch Blender, go to Edit> Preferences>Addons>Install(localy) and choose that downloaded zip file

It will add a `Skin Weights Copypaster` panel to the Item tab in the viewport menu (show-hide on N key), this panel is visible in Edit and Weight Paint mode
